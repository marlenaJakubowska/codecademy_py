# Create a function called x_length_words that takes a string named sentence and an integer named x as parameters.
# This function should return True if every word in sentence has a length greater than or equal to x.

# Write your x_length_words function here:


def x_length_words(sentence, x):
    list_sentence = sentence.split()
    for word in list_sentence:
        if len(word) < x:
            return False
    return True


# Uncomment these function calls to test your tip function:
print(x_length_words("i like apples", 2))
# should print False
print(x_length_words("he likes apples", 2))
# should print True
