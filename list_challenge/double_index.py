# Create a function named double_index that has two parameters named lst and index.
# The function should return a new list where all elements are the same as in lst except
# for the element at index, which should be double the value of the element at index of lst.
# If index is not a valid index, the function should return the original list.
# For example, the following code should return [1,2,6,4] because the element at index 2 has been doubled:
# double_index([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)


def double_index(lst, index):
    if index >= len(lst):
        return lst
    else:
        new_lst = lst[0:index]
        new_lst.append(lst[index]*2)
        new_lst = new_lst + lst[index+1:]
        return new_lst


print(double_index([3, 8, -10, 12], 2))
